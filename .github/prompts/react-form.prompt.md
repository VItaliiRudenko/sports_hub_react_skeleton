## Step 1
Generate code Using react-i18next, react-bootstrap, HTML and CSS. 
Follow the following steps: 
Generate a Heading with the bold name `Add Group`.  
The first section's visibility could be toggled by clicking the arrow at the bottom right. The section should be col the part of the Row.  It contains two vertical numbered navigation items, `Group details` and `Add User`. `Add User` should be disabled by default. 
The second section contains the heading `group detail` and a paragraph with the text `Enter the group name and an optional description.`. The section should be col the part of the Row. Create Input field named `Name` with the validation for more than 50 symbols and error message below if validation exceeds 50 symbols. Text field named `Description`.  
The new horizontal section should be a cancel link, and on the right, two buttons, `Next` and `Back.` 
Everything should be within a white container for 70% of the page and positioned right. Also, it is important to provide I18n configuration and required CSS styles file. Create two components - App and AddGroup and export them as default.
